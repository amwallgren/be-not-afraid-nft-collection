The purpose of this Dapp is to empower users to acquire basic artwork-nfts in a simple and fun way. 

This Dapp only requires the user to have metamask installed, otherwise thereâ€™s no need for any coding or other web3-experience and knowledge.

Art should be for everyone, and my Dapp is intended to function as a bridge between everyday users and the world of art in web3.

Simply visit the website, connect your wallet, and transfer Mumbai test-ETH to my smart contract.
In return you'll receive a unique NFT, to safely store in your wallet.

This Dapp prioritizes simplicity, and is intended to be as user-friendly as possible.
No coding skills needed on the users part!

Acquiring art should be as enjoyable as appreciating it. 
Let's focus on the excitement of owning a unique digital artwork without any unnecessary complications.
